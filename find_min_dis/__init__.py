"""
Algorithm to find the two numbers whose difference is minimum among the set of numbers.
For example the sequence is 5, 13, 7, 0, 10, 20, 1, 15, 4, 19
The algorithm should return min diff = 20-19 = 1.
Constraint - Time Complexity O(N) & Space is not a constraint [upto O(3N)]
Assumption - Sorting O(nlogn) & comparison of adjacent numbers is already known & is
not an option. Try to keep it linear
